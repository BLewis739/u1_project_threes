## **_Description_**

Threes game is an app similar to the popular 2048 game. The player is given a board of tiles, and uses the arrow keys to move them. When smaller titles combine, they change their values to higher numbers. Once the board is full and no moves can be made, the game is over and the player's score is calculated.

The startegy of threes differs from 2048 because there is a greater variety in the values of new tiles. In 2048, every new tile is a 2 or 4, so a player can simply stack tiles along one edge of the board indefinitely. In threes, higher value tiles are often generated as new tiles, which can disrupt a player's attempt to place higher value tiles along an edge.

The original threes game is available here: [Play Threes Game](http://play.threesgame.com/)
